Dear {{Rep.Title}} {{Rep.LastName}},

Since January 1st, 2016, there have been {{VictimCount}} victims of mass shootings in the United States.

Today, {{Incident.InjuredCount}} people were injured, and {{Incident.KilledCount}} were killed in shooting in {{Incident.City}}, {{Incident.State}}.

Gun violence is quickly becoming one of the worst public health crises of the 21st century, and I'm writing to plead you do something about it.

Lax gun laws allow anyone to purchase a gun with little or no oversight, when 90% of Americans support common sense gun laws such as background checks. Please take action to end this rampant, senseless violence.

Don't betray the trust I've put in you by giving you my vote. Take action now to protect your citizens from the most deadly epidemic of the 21st century.

Thank you,
